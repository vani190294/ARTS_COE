 Webslesson     23:22     Ajax, JQuery, mysql, php     23 comments   



In this post I show you delete multiple records from mysql database on the basis of selected checkbox in php. You have show lots of tutorial on this things but today I have show you how to use Ajax and JQuery for delete multiple records on the basis of checked checkboxes on one single click without page refresh. When user want to remove multiple table show he can checked checkbox of that table row and click on delete button when system will ask you do you want to delete this records if he click yes then it again validate that use has checked check box or not if he not select any check box then system will again display alert message regarding please select atleast one checkbox and if user has select one or multiple checkboxes then user can remove multiple table row with background color change and fade out effect with out page refresh. For this things I have used ajax function call in jquery code. With help of Ajax it execute delete code from delete.php file. So, this is my tutorial on how to use Ajax to delete Multiple records from database with change background color of table and fade out effect without page refresh.




Source Code

index.php

<?php
//index.php
$connect = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "", "testing");
$query = "SELECT * FROM tbl_customer";
$result = mysqli_query($connect, $query);
?>

   });
   
   if(id.length === 0) //tell you if the array is empty
   {
    alert("Please Select atleast one checkbox");
   }
   else
   {
    $.ajax({
     url:'delete.php',
     method:'POST',
     data:{id:id},
     success:function()
     {
      for(var i=0; i<id.length; i++)

       $('tr#'+id[i]+'').css('background-color', '#ccc');
       $('tr#'+id[i]+'').fadeOut('slow');
      }
     }
     
    });
   }
   
  }
  else
  {
   return false;
  }
 });
 
});

<?php
//delete.php
$connect = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "", "testing");
if(isset($_POST["id"]))
{
 foreach($_POST["id"] as $id)
 {
  $query = "DELETE FROM tbl_customer WHERE CustomerID = '".$id."'";
  mysqli_query($connect, $query);

Nice work. I'm just having issues refreshing data that has been posted using Ajax. The post is successfully being executed, but the data on the view does not get refreshed with the new data.

Instead of deleting the selected rows, I would like to INSERT to a new table in the database, say selected_customers, the rows I selected in this example. Do you have a source code/example for that? That will be much appreciated.
